Now when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this. So, you know, you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that with some heavier days later on, everything gets done, things taste civil. And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then actually the paper would come along and then I would kind of do this. And that would happen every single paper. But then came my 90-page senior thesis. A paper you're supposed to spend a year on. I knew for a paper like that, my normal workflow was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I planned things out and I decided I kind of had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I'd start off light and I'd bump it up in the middle months. And then at the end, I would kick it up into high gears. It's like a little staircase. How hard are you going to be just walk up the stairs? No big deal, right? But then the funniest thing happened. Those first few months, they came and went and I couldn't quite do stuff. So we had an awesome new revised plan. And then those middle months actually went by and I didn't really write words. And so we were here. And then two months turned into one month. It turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline. Still not having written a word. And so I did the only thing I could. I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-nighters. Humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters. Sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion and got it in just at the deadline. I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later I get a call. It's the school. And they say, is this Tim Urban? And I say, yeah. And they say, we need to talk about your thesis. And I say, OK. And they say, it's the best one we've ever seen. That did not happen. It was a very, very bad thesis. I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought this guy is amazing. No, no. It was very, very bad. Anyway, today I'm a writer, blogger, guy. I write the blog, wait, but why? And a couple of years ago I decided to write about procrastination. My behavior is always perplexed the non- procrastinators around me. And I wanted to explain to the non- procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators and why we are the way we are. Now I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non- procrastinator. And so I could compare them. And I actually brought them here to show you today. And I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference. And I know that if you're not a trained brain expert, it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK? So here's the brain of a non- procrastinator. Now here's my brain. There is a difference. Both brains have a rational decision maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an instant gratification monkey. Now what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens. So the rational decision maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the monkey doesn't like that plan. So he actually takes the wheel, and he says, actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan Tanya Harding scandal, because I just remember that that happened. Then we're going to go over to the fridge. We're going to see if there's anything new in there since ten minutes ago. After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman, talking about magnets and ends much, much later, with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom. All of that's going to take a while, so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today, sorry. Now, what is going on here? The Instagram notification monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment. He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things, easy and fun. Now, in the animal world, that works fine. If you're a dog, and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success. And to the monkey, humans are just another animal species. You have to keep well slept, well fed, and propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times might have worked okay. But if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times. We're in an advanced civilization, and the monkey does not know what that is, which is why we have another guy in our brain, the rational decision maker, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do. We can visualize the future, we can see the big picture, we can make long-term plans, and he wants to take all of that into account, and he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well or in leisure time. That's why there's an overlap. Sometimes they agree. But other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant for the sake of the big picture, and that's when we have a conflict. And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the makes sense circle. I call it the dark playground. Now, the dark playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well. It's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the dark playground isn't actually fun because it's completely unearned, and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred, all those good procrastinator feelings. And the question is, in this situation with the monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone? A less pleasant place, but where really important things happen? Well, it turns out that the procrastinator has a guardian angel, someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments. Someone called the panic monster. Now, the panic monster is dormant most of the time, but it suddenly wakes up. Anytime a deadline gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other scary consequence, and importantly, he's the only thing that the monkey is terrified of. Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently because people of Ted reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED talk. Now, of course, I said, yes, it's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED talk in the past. But in the middle of all this excitement, the rational decision-maker seemed to have something else in his mind. He was saying, are we clear on what we just accepted? Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future? We need to sit down and work on this right now. And the monkey said, totally agree, but also let's just open Google Earth and let's zoom into the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground, and we're going to scroll up two and a half hours until we get to the top of the country so we can get a better feel for India. So that's what we did that day. As six months turned into four and then two and then one, the people of Ted decided to release the speakers. And I opened up the website and there was my face staring right back at me and guess who woke up. So the panic monster starts losing his mind, and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem. And the monkey, who remember, he's terrified of the panic monster, boom, he's up the tree. And finally, finally, the rational decision maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk. Now, the panic monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinated behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages. And this entire situation with the three characters, this is the procrastinator's system. It's not pretty, but in the end, it works. And this is what I decided to write about on the blog just a couple years ago. Now, when I did, I was amazed by the response. Literally thousands of emails came in from all different kinds of people, from all over the world, doing all different kinds of things. These are people who were nurses and bankers and painters and engineers and lots and lots of PhD students. And they were all writing saying the same thing, I have this problem too. But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails. These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what this monkey had done to them. And I thought about this and I said, if the procrastinator system works, then what's going on? Why are all these people in such a dark place? Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination. Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given, they all have deadlines. And when there's deadlines, the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the panic monster gets involved. But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline. So if you wanted to have a career where you want to be a self-starter, something in the arts, something entrepreneurial, there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening at first, not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get some momentum to get things going. There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship, or getting out of a relationship that isn't working. Now, if procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the panic monster, that's a problem because in all of these non-deadline situations, the panic monster doesn't show up, he's nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained, they just extend outward forever. And it's this long-term kind of procrastination that's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier short-term deadline-based kind. It's usually suffered quietly and privately, and it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness and regrets. And I thought, you know, that's why these people are emailing, and that's why they're in such a bad place. It's not that they're cramming for some project, it's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator at times in their own lives. You know, the frustration was not that they couldn't achieve their dreams, it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them. So, I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany that I don't think non- procrastinators exist. That's right, I think all of you are procrastinators. Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us. And some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines, but remember, the monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there. Now, I want to show you one last thing. I call this a life calendar. That's one box for every week of a 90-year life. That's not that many boxes, especially since we've already used a bunch of those. So, I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar. And we need to think about what we're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something in life. We need to stay aware of the instant gratification monkey. That's a job for all of us. And because there's not that many boxes on there, it's a job that should probably start today. Well, maybe not today, but... You know, sometimes soon. Thank you.\n```\n\nFeatures:\n```json\n{\n  \"duration\": 843.7087074829932,\n  \"pitch_mean\": 211.93199029656986,\n  \"pitch_std\": 114.53415772270607,\n  \"pitch_min\": 65.40639132514966,\n  \"pitch_max\": 2057.0479574677915,\n  \"pitch_range\": 1991.641566142642,\n  \"volume_mean\": 0.07034281641244888,\n  \"volume_std\": 0.06164080649614334,\n  \"volume_min\": 4.213083229842596e-06,\n  \"volume_max\": 0.29681867361068726,\n  \"volume_range\": 0.2968144714832306,\n  \"volume_change_rate\": 0.012735841795802116,\n  \"speech_rate\": 3.535580436166269,\n  \"zero_crossing_rate\": 0.1250032654211732,\n  \"num_pauses\": 120,\n  \"total_pause_duration\": 105.83655328798186,\n  \"mean_pause_duration\": 0.8819712773998488,\n  \"pause_frequency\": 0.14222918281594107,\n  \"spectral_centroid_mean\": 2209.4742884683724,\n  \"spectral_bandwidth_mean\": 2053.538018258321,\n  \"spectral_contrast_mean\": 21.146407284660395,\n  \"mfcc1_mean\": -231.36622619628906,\n  \"mfcc1_std\": 103.27669525146484,\n  \"mfcc2_mean\": 101.39031982421875,\n  \"mfcc2_std\": 50.26768112182617,\n  \"mfcc3_mean\": -20.31424331665039,\n  \"mfcc3_std\": 31.64164161682129,\n  \"mfcc4_mean\": 16.000944137573242,\n  \"mfcc4_std\": 25.813289642333984,\n  \"mfcc5_mean\": -4.998349666595459,\n  \"mfcc5_std\": 20.650907516479492,\n  \"mfcc6_mean\": -8.895711898803711,\n  \"mfcc6_std\": 15.62430191040039,\n  \"mfcc7_mean\": -11.183443069458008,\n  \"mfcc7_std\": 14.501937866210938,\n  \"mfcc8_mean\": -8.483296394348145,\n  \"mfcc8_std\": 13.497403144836426,\n  \"mfcc9_mean\": -10.268962860107422,\n  \"mfcc9_std\": 11.768165588378906,\n  \"mfcc10_mean\": -1.1824480295181274,\n  \"mfcc10_std\": 10.713696479797363,\n  \"mfcc11_mean\": -5.553489685058594,\n  \"mfcc11_std\": 10.116046905517578,\n  \"mfcc12_mean\": -2.7221832275390625,\n  \"mfcc12_std\": 9.17386245727539,\n  \"mfcc13_mean\": -4.600059986114502,\n  \"mfcc13_std\": 8.695734024047852,\n  \"word_count\": 2349,\n  \"sentence_count\": 144,\n  \"avg_words_per_sentence\": 16.3125,\n  \"avg_word_length\": 4.156662409535973,\n  \"unique_word_count\": 617,\n  \"filler_word_counts\": {\n    \"um\": 0,\n    \"uh\": 0,\n    \"ah\": 0,\n    \"er\": 0,\n    \"like\": 14,\n    \"you know\": 4,\n    \"sort of\": 0,\n    \"kind of\": 4,\n    \"i mean\": 0,\n    \"basically\": 0,\n    \"actually\": 8,\n    \"literally\": 1,\n    \"so\": 19,\n    \"right\": 5,\n    \"well\": 8,\n    \"anyway\": 1,\n    \"okay\": 1,\n    \"mmmm\": 0,\n    \"hmm\": 0\n  },\n  \"total_filler_words\": 65,\n  \"filler_word_rate\": 2.7671349510429972,\n  \"lexical_diversity\": 0.4672645739910314,\n  \"most_common_words\": {\n    \"'s\": 56,\n    \"'re\": 16,\n    \"like\": 14,\n    \"things\": 13,\n    \"going\": 12,\n    \"n't\": 12,\n    \"monkey\": 12,\n    \"procrastinator\": 11,\n    \"get\": 9,\n    \"two\": 9\n  },\n  \"unique_content_words\": 521,\n  \"hapax_percentage\": 62.95585412667947,\n  \"mean_sentence_length\": 18.444444444444443,\n  \"median_sentence_length\": 16.0,\n  \"min_sentence_length\": 3,\n  \"max_sentence_length\": 64,\n  \"std_sentence_length\": 11.94069708658503,\n  \"sentence_length_distribution\": {\n    \"20-24\": 13.194444444444445,\n    \"35-39\": 3.4722222222222223,\n    \"10-14\": 19.444444444444446,\n    \"5-9\": 23.61111111111111,\n    \"25-29\": 11.11111111111111,\n    \"15-19\": 18.055555555555554,\n    \"0-4\": 2.083333333333333,\n    \"40-44\": 1.3888888888888888,\n    \"45-49\": 2.083333333333333,\n    \"30-34\": 2.7777777777777777,\n    \"60-64\": 2.083333333333333,\n    \"50-54\": 0.6944444444444444\n  },\n  \"flesch_kincaid_grade\": 7.007549755214988,\n  \"gunning_fog_index\": 9.930704555129843,\n  \"complex_word_percentage\": 8.514261387824607,\n  \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.3759046402724564,\n  \"words_per_minute\": 167.0481752173228,\n  \"vocal_expressiveness\": 0.8082040324807167,\n  \"speech_clarity\": 0.7018043270094028\n}\n```", "output": "Overall Assessment\nThis TED talk on procrastination effectively balances humor with insight, using personal storytelling and relatable metaphors to explain complex psychological concepts. At 167 words per minute with excellent vocal variety (pitch variation of 114.53), the speaker maintains strong audience engagement throughout. The presentation uses strategic pauses (120 in total, averaging 0.88 seconds) to emphasize key points and allow humor to land. The metaphorical framework of the \"rational decision maker,\" \"instant gratification monkey,\" and \"panic monster\" makes abstract concepts concrete and memorable. While the filler word rate (2.77%) is slightly higher than ideal, it doesn't significantly detract from the presentation's coherence or impact.\nKey Scores (1-10)\n\nClarity: 8/10 (Reasoning: The speaker maintains a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 7.01, making complex psychological concepts accessible through clear metaphors. The speech clarity score of 0.702 shows good articulation, and the lexical diversity of 0.467 indicates vocabulary that's varied without being overwhelming. The explanation of the \"procrastinator's system\" with three characters creates a simple, intuitive framework that makes abstract concepts tangible.)\nEngagement: 9/10 (Reasoning: The speaker excels at storytelling, beginning with the relatable college thesis experience and using self-deprecating humor: \"I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later I get a call... it's the best one we've ever seen. That did not happen.\" The impressive pitch variation (std of 114.53) creates vocal dynamics that maintain interest throughout the presentation.)\nPacing: 8/10 (Reasoning: At 167.05 words per minute, the speaker maintains an ideal pace for comprehension while keeping energy high. The strategic use of 120 pauses throughout the presentation provides breathing room for audience processing while building anticipation for punchlines and key points.)\nVocal Variety: 9/10 (Reasoning: The pitch standard deviation of 114.53 and volume standard deviation of 0.061 demonstrate exceptional vocal expressiveness. The speaker varies tone dramatically between the playful \"monkey\" descriptions and more serious reflections on long-term regrets, creating contrast that keeps the audience engaged.)\n\nStrengths\n\nMasterful use of metaphor and visualization: The speaker creates a compelling visual framework for understanding procrastination through three characters: the rational decision maker, instant gratification monkey, and panic monster. This metaphor makes abstract psychological concepts concrete and memorable. (Evidence: The detailed explanations of each character's role, like \"He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things, easy and fun\" for the monkey, create clear mental images that explain complex behavior patterns.)\nEffective personal storytelling: The speaker uses self-disclosure about their own procrastination struggles to establish credibility and rapport. The 90-page thesis story with its vivid details (\"I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-nighters\") creates a narrative arc that engages the audience emotionally while illustrating the concept. (Evidence: The transcript shows detailed personal anecdotes used throughout, particularly in the opening thesis story and the TED talk preparation example.)\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\nReduce filler words: The speaker uses 65 total filler words (2.77% rate), with \"so\" (19), \"like\" (14), \"actually\" (8), and \"well\" (8) being most common. (Issue: Excessive filler words can undermine authority; Evidence: The filler word counts in the features JSON; Suggestion: Practice identifying trigger points for fillers, particularly at the beginning of sentences, and replace them with intentional pauses instead.)\nStrengthen the conclusion: The ending feels somewhat rushed and contradicts itself with \"it's a job that should probably start today. Well, maybe not today, but... You know, sometimes soon.\" (Issue: The weakened conclusion undermines the call to action; Evidence: The final sentences in the transcript; Suggestion: Commit to a stronger closing statement that reinforces the urgency established by the \"life calendar\" visual, perhaps with a specific challenge for the audience.)\n\nContent & Structure Analysis\nThis presentation examines procrastination through a humorous yet insightful framework. The speaker develops a three-part model of the procrastinator's brain - the rational decision maker, the instant gratification monkey, and the panic monster - to explain why we procrastinate and how it affects our lives.\nThe talk follows a clear structure that builds from personal anecdote to theoretical model to broader implications. It begins with the speaker's college thesis experience, establishing credibility and relatability. The middle section introduces the brain model using amusing visualizations and examples like the \"dark playground.\" The presentation then pivots to a crucial insight - distinguishing between deadline-based procrastination and the more insidious \"long-term procrastination\" that affects life goals without deadlines. The speaker concludes with the powerful visual of a \"life calendar\" showing the limited weeks in a human lifespan.\nThe organization is effective, using humor throughout while gradually deepening the message from amusing self-deprecation to profound life implications. Transitions are smooth, particularly when moving from the humorous brain model to the more serious consequences: \"But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails.\" This structure creates a presentation that entertains while delivering meaningful psychological insights about human behavior."}

Seven years ago I embarked on a journey to analyze 5,000 public speakers from all over the world, amateurs and professionals, in order to distill and understand what makes a good speaker good, what makes a great speaker great, and what makes an outstanding speaker outstanding. The result, 110 core skills. With loads of sub-skills. So what does it look like? It looks like this. These are the 110 core skills and the equation is simple. The more of them you fulfill the greater you are. Now 110 skills, that's quite a tad too many to go through in one TED talk, don't you agree? So what I've done is I've picked out my absolute favorites and I'd like to show you a demonstration of what it can look like. Imagine that this chair is something that you want somebody else to believe in, you want somebody else to buy into this, this is your idea, this is you wanting to make your voice hard. This gives you two options. Either you're on this side of the chair and you're a fairly mediocre communicator, you shoot from the hip, you hope for the best, and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Option number two is that you're on this side of the chair and you know exactly what you're doing in every instance of time. You know that by taking a step forward, you increase focus. You know that by tilting your head slightly to the side, you increase empathy. You know that by changing the pace of what you are saying, you increase focus. And you know that by shifting yourself lower, you increase trust and you know that by lowering your voice, you get anticipation and you know for absolute certainty. But if you pause, you get absolute and undivided attention. Now the question then is, can everyone be on this side of the chair? Can everyone become good at these skills? What do you think the answer is? Of course it is. Why? Because it's call presentation skills, skills, skills, skills, skills, skills. It is not, has never been, shall never be called a talent. You're not born with a particular gene that makes you brilliant on stage. Something you acquired through life. Now as I said 110 skills, that's quite the number. So what I've chosen to do is I've picked out the five, would I say, most important skills. Whenever somebody comes to me and they want coaching, this is what I focus on. And then I'll actually give you four bonus skills at the end as well. Sounds okay? So let's start with two of my favourites from body language, which is skill 34 and skill 69. That is not intentional. Not 34. What am I doing? What could I be doing differently in this case? Ladies and gentlemen, it is an absolute pleasure to have you here today. Good of you to come. What should I have avoided? I should have avoided closing my body language because whenever a human being closes their body language, it is a sign that they feel threatened in one way or another. So I should have continued with an open and broad language. So let's have a look at number 69, which looks like this. I'll have to start up here. So when a presenter starts like this, they go, what should I do better now? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to one of the most influential subjects known to mankind. Now this will be super interesting. We'll be going through this. You'll have it having an amazing time. Wow. Let's go away. What should I have avoided? Reversing. Look what a double incorrect looks like. It looks like this. Ladies and gentlemen, absolute pleasure to have you here. Good of you to come. What a double correct looks like this. Ladies and gentlemen, an absolute pleasure to have you here. Good of you to come. Is there a difference? Of course there is. The biggest difference is in here. I can feel a difference while doing those two versions. You become what you are. Now let's ask ourselves, yeah, but David, the close body language things. What should I do with my hands? Where shall I put them? And the interesting thing with the close body language is that wherever I went, all over the world studying these people, it seems like we've got a general kind of locked body language positions. And I'll show you my favorites that I found. We've obviously got the classical fig leaf position. Then we have the double bunny position. You have the right bunny position, the left bunny position, the right hockled, the left tackle. Then you have the forklift. You of course have the peacock with flapping elbows. You have the major, the merkel, the prayer and the beggar. One of my personal favorites is the British horse rider and the British horse rider. It's a person who holds their hands like this, puts it just above their chest and it's like they're off somewhere. Oh, God, they're a fox over here. And then we found two T-rexes as well in the study. Such a weird thing presenting like this or like this. Okay, so you mean, David, that we need to have an open body language. Yeah, that's what I mean. And I'm not allowed to have them in my pockets, not allowed to have them in my major or the double bunny. No. But what on earth shall I do with them then? What you should use them for is what is called functional gesturing to show there's something is getting better. Well, that something is getting less good or that it's one, two, three, four, five that we are going to go through. Use your gestures for what they're supposed to be used for. And what's interesting with this is that if you imagine the time we've spent on this planet as our race, how much of that time have we spent using gestures and non-verbal communication in order to communicate what we're saying? Is that more than verbal? Absolutely. Give me, let me give you a demonstration of how important it is. So I'll say something now and everything I say will be super positive. My facial expressions will be super positive and the way I say it will be super positive, but my hands will be saying the opposite. Are you with me? This requires some focus. All of you should learn more about public speaking because if you do that, you will become better. You will grow and you will develop as a human being. You will love your presentations, listening to your arguments and just generally loving whatever you're doing. So do yourself a great favor. Learn more about this particular subject because you'll be thanking yourself for the rest of your life. And particularly you have been absolutely incredible, so I thank you for listening here. Thank you. The question is this, did you listen to what I was saying or what I was doing? I believe that you focused entirely on what I was doing and that is the case with bottle language and gestures if it's not saying the same thing as what you're saying verbally. There's a discrepancy and a disturbance in the communication. Let's move on from bottle language to a couple of tips on voice. And the first one I'm going to give you is about pace. So listen to this. Ladies and gentlemen, what I'm going to take you through now is incredibly important now and for the rest of your future life, we'll go through the cortex, we'll go through the limbic and the reptilian system. We'll go through a psychological advanced profile where we'll take you through the entire steps of the structure, we'll then look at how that relates to Aristotle as if there's logos and pathos and I'll carry on in this pace. Compare that to this. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm now going to take you through something that is entirely and utterly boring. Everything that you will have no use of in your entire life and every second spent listening to me now and on will be a waste of time. Now look at your faces. You're like, whoa, that last bit. I want more of that. That was super interesting. The useless stuff. Yeah. I don't want the brain so much. I want the second bit. Why? Because your brains, they react to when a person has a low pace, you think that what I'm saying is more important than whenever I have a high pace because that illustrates that I don't really want to be there. There are exceptions to this rule, but that is the basics. So keep a calm pace. My next tip goes on pauses. The pause is the pause important. Absolutely it is. So let me give you a classical rhetorical proverb. Now without pauses and it goes like this. Did you know that every single decision you've taken in your entire life and will take for the rest of your life is based on one thing and one thing only? If you give that to the people listening to you, that is the feeling. That is what will move them. Now I'll add pauses. And it sounds like this. Did you know that every single decision you've taken in your entire life and you will take for the rest of your life is based on one thing and one thing only? And that is an emotion. Now if you give that emotion to the people listening to you, they will take the decisions you want them to take. Is there a difference? Absolutely. But you know what? Some people are afraid of the pause. So you go like, whoa, am I going to do one of those? I'm not. I refuse. I prefer to compromise. And do you know what the compromise for a pause is? What does it sound like? Yeah. It's like a scock of sheep when you listen to certain conferences. Now there's nothing among these 110 skills that lowers your ethos and your credibility more than erring because it signals that you don't know what you are saying and where you're going in your talk. So let me give you an demonstration. Did you know that every single decision you've taken in your entire life and will take for the rest of your life is based on one thing and one thing only? And that is a feeling. I think you prefer the one with silence. Now those were the five main skills I wanted to take you through. And if you haven't used them before and you start using them as a public speaker, they will make a difference to your speech. I would like to treat you to four small skills as well. Just to give you an appreciation of how small a skill can be, but still have a great impact. It looks like this. And those were the four skills. Did you follow them? Number one, as I looked up, which illustrates that I'm thinking, which increases your sense of presence for me on stage. The second thing I did was that I did an audible inhale, which makes your brain believe that I'm going to say something that's exciting. I then combined that with a Duquesne smile, which means that I smile with my mouth and with my eyes. Did you fall for it? Because what I did as well was this. I did a self laughter and also that increases anticipation of what I'm going to say. So four small skills executed in five seconds, changes the state of your mind. I'd like to pick out one of those and just end off with that. And that is the Duquesne smile. Duquesne smiles has in studies shown that you are more likely to be married, less likely to be divorced. You're happier, you're more content with life. And you actually are more relaxed in situations like this. So I asked myself, am I a Duquesne smiling person? And to figure that out, I walked over to my computer and I logged in and I looked at all my 60,000 Google photos. They're not all on me, but family members and others. I looked at mine and it seemed like my brain required short of a miracle to do a Duquesne smile. You know, where you smile with your entire face. I thought that's not fair. And considering the psychological benefits, I better learn this. So I spent not four but six months learning how to do a Duquesne smile. And suddenly my brain was launching Duquesne smiles in just everyday happiness. It's beautiful and I felt happier as a human being. I want to show you what it looks like. Now every time I go on my summer holidays, I take a photo of myself. And these were the last years of those photos. This was 2014, it's no Duquesne smile. 2015, definitely no Duquesne smile. 2016, still no Duquesne smile. 2017, no Duquesne smile. This year, Duquesne smile. Does it make a difference? Absolutely, it brings joy to you and stability to me. Now we've come to the end of this talk and I would like to end with something that relates to boxing. You know, Muhammad Ali and the likes, they have combinations for when they're going to strike somebody, knock out. And the same kind of combinations exist in public speaking as well. So what I'd like to show you is this combination. I'm going to start with a number 34, go to number eight and then we'll carry on to 69 and 98 to 67 and 18, 22 and a 101 and 21. Are you ready for the combination? Okay, looks like this. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you've had fun, that you have learned, but more than anything, I hope that you feel inspired to become a greater public speaker. Because anybody can become good, anybody can be great and everybody can become outstanding because it all comes down to one single thing.\n```\n\nFeatures:\n```json\n{\n  \"duration\": 1011.3683900226757,\n  \"pitch_mean\": 184.44963295299053,\n  \"pitch_std\": 116.16086231309815,\n  \"pitch_min\": 65.7852866955572,\n  \"pitch_max\": 1479.9776908465376,\n  \"pitch_range\": 1414.1924041509803,\n  \"volume_mean\": 0.051843300461769104,\n  \"volume_std\": 0.05386125668883324,\n  \"volume_min\": 0.0,\n  \"volume_max\": 0.3901081383228302,\n  \"volume_range\": 0.3901081383228302,\n  \"volume_change_rate\": 0.008672473952174187,\n  \"speech_rate\": 3.561511349904104,\n  \"zero_crossing_rate\": 0.13657953093432168,\n  \"num_pauses\": 206,\n  \"total_pause_duration\": 252.56344671201813,\n  \"mean_pause_duration\": 1.2260361490874667,\n  \"pause_frequency\": 0.2036844358912397,\n  \"spectral_centroid_mean\": 2143.3363391746316,\n  \"spectral_bandwidth_mean\": 1717.4657560171433,\n  \"spectral_contrast_mean\": 22.70217562497665,\n  \"mfcc1_mean\": -291.67657470703125,\n  \"mfcc1_std\": 122.47415924072266,\n  \"mfcc2_mean\": 82.64569854736328,\n  \"mfcc2_std\": 61.38431930541992,\n  \"mfcc3_mean\": -38.78310775756836,\n  \"mfcc3_std\": 37.60011672973633,\n  \"mfcc4_mean\": 22.84308433532715,\n  \"mfcc4_std\": 25.477685928344727,\n  \"mfcc5_mean\": -7.3149800300598145,\n  \"mfcc5_std\": 20.820335388183594,\n  \"mfcc6_mean\": -32.305660247802734,\n  \"mfcc6_std\": 23.702695846557617,\n  \"mfcc7_mean\": -25.1691951751709,\n  \"mfcc7_std\": 16.208980560302734,\n  \"mfcc8_mean\": -10.176916122436523,\n  \"mfcc8_std\": 11.295272827148438,\n  \"mfcc9_mean\": -9.137925148010254,\n  \"mfcc9_std\": 12.296454429626465,\n  \"mfcc10_mean\": 2.1485683917999268,\n  \"mfcc10_std\": 8.961270332336426,\n  \"mfcc11_mean\": -5.403688907623291,\n  \"mfcc11_std\": 9.040321350097656,\n  \"mfcc12_mean\": -9.920876502990723,\n  \"mfcc12_std\": 9.958850860595703,\n  \"mfcc13_mean\": -2.973590612411499,\n  \"mfcc13_std\": 8.518805503845215,\n  \"word_count\": 2484,\n  \"sentence_count\": 206,\n  \"avg_words_per_sentence\": 12.058252427184467,\n  \"avg_word_length\": 4.096618357487923,\n  \"unique_word_count\": 584,\n  \"filler_word_counts\": {\n    \"um\": 0,\n    \"uh\": 0,\n    \"ah\": 0,\n    \"er\": 0,\n    \"like\": 29,\n    \"you know\": 14,\n    \"sort of\": 0,\n    \"kind of\": 2,\n    \"i mean\": 1,\n    \"basically\": 0,\n    \"actually\": 2,\n    \"literally\": 0,\n    \"so\": 21,\n    \"right\": 3,\n    \"well\": 6,\n    \"anyway\": 0,\n    \"okay\": 3,\n    \"mmmm\": 0,\n    \"hmm\": 0\n  },\n  \"total_filler_words\": 81,\n  \"filler_word_rate\": 3.260869565217391,\n  \"lexical_diversity\": 0.4460431654676259,\n  \"most_common_words\": {\n    \"like\": 29,\n    \"'s\": 23,\n    \"skills\": 18,\n    \"one\": 17,\n    \"'re\": 17,\n    \"know\": 15,\n    \"'ll\": 15,\n    \"life\": 12,\n    \"'ve\": 12,\n    \"duquesne\": 12\n  },\n  \"unique_content_words\": 496,\n  \"hapax_percentage\": 63.50806451612904,\n  \"mean_sentence_length\": 13.645631067961165,\n  \"median_sentence_length\": 11.0,\n  \"min_sentence_length\": 2,\n  \"max_sentence_length\": 51,\n  \"std_sentence_length\": 10.072342953003451,\n  \"sentence_length_distribution\": {\n    \"25-29\": 6.310679611650485,\n    \"50-54\": 0.48543689320388345,\n    \"5-9\": 35.92233009708738,\n    \"10-14\": 20.87378640776699,\n    \"20-24\": 6.796116504854369,\n    \"35-39\": 3.3980582524271843,\n    \"15-19\": 14.077669902912621,\n    \"30-34\": 2.4271844660194173,\n    \"0-4\": 7.766990291262135,\n    \"45-49\": 1.4563106796116505,\n    \"40-44\": 0.48543689320388345\n  },\n  \"flesch_kincaid_grade\": 4.941059831465065,\n  \"gunning_fog_index\": 8.317664900020324,\n  \"complex_word_percentage\": 8.735909822866345,\n  \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.3413848631239935,\n  \"words_per_minute\": 147.36470060791441,\n  \"vocal_expressiveness\": 0.7693062834441662,\n  \"speech_clarity\": 0.842608358736149\n}\n```", "output": "Overall Assessment\nDavid JP Phillips delivers an engaging presentation on public speaking techniques, focusing on his research of 110 core communication skills. He expertly demonstrates these techniques while teaching them, showing strong command of vocal variety, strategic pausing, and body language. While engaging and well-structured, improvements in pacing consistency and filler word reduction would enhance his delivery effectiveness.\nKey Scores (1-10)\n\nClarity: 8 (Reasoning: Well-structured content with accessible language (Flesch-Kincaid grade: 4.94) and clear demonstrations of communication techniques make complex concepts understandable.)\nEngagement: 9 (Reasoning: Excels through interactive elements, humor, demonstrations, and personal stories. Vocal expressiveness score of 0.769 and lexical diversity of 0.446 confirm strong audience engagement.)\nPacing: 7 (Reasoning: Good control at 147.36 WPM with strategic variations, but sometimes rapid (speech rate: 3.56). Effective use of 206 pauses (average 1.22s), though transitions could be smoother.)\nVocal Variety: 9 (Reasoning: Excellent variety with wide pitch range (1414.19) and volume range (0.39). Masterfully demonstrates pace changes, pitch modulation, and volume control as teaching tools.)\n\nStrengths\n\nPractical Demonstration of Concepts: Rather than just explaining techniques, the speaker actively demonstrates them, creating powerful learning moments through contrasting examples of effective vs. ineffective communication methods.\nEffective Use of Humor and Personal Stories: Maintains engagement through well-timed humor and his personal journey learning the \"Duquesne smile,\" humanizing the content and demonstrating commitment to his techniques.\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\nFiller Word Reduction: 81 total filler words (3.26% rate) including 29 \"like\" instances. (Suggestion: Record practice presentations, identify trigger points for fillers, replace with strategic pauses.)\nSentence Length Consistency: High variance (std_deviation: 10.07) with extremes from 2 to 51 words. (Suggestion: Aim for more consistent 10-20 word sentences for key points, breaking complex ideas into digestible segments.)\n\nContent & Structure Analysis\nThis presentation explains communication techniques distilled from research of 5,000 speakers into 110 core skills. The content follows a clear framework: introducing the research, demonstrating five core skills, adding bonus techniques, and delivering an inspirational conclusion. Effective metaphors (the chair representing skill levels, boxing combinations for presentation techniques) make abstract concepts concrete. The progression from body language to vocal techniques to the \"Duquesne smile\" creates a coherent narrative that builds toward the inspirational message that \"anybody can become good, anybody can be great and everybody can become outstanding."}

The brevity (just 13 words) creates a powerful impact through its focused metaphorical comparison. The delivery is measured and contemplative, allowing the listener to absorb the emotional weight of the comparison. While the speech rate is slow, this appears deliberate to enhance the poetic delivery, creating an appropriate pace for the content's reflective nature.\nKey Scores (1-10)\n\nClarity: 8 (Reasoning: Despite its brevity, the message is clear through the well-constructed metaphor. The Flesch-Kincaid grade of 5.82 indicates accessibility while maintaining poetic depth. The speech clarity score of 0.485 shows good articulation even with the deliberate slow pace.)\nEngagement: 7 (Reasoning: The metaphorical comparison immediately creates visual imagery that engages the listener. The perfect lexical diversity score of 1.0 means every word is unique and purposeful, with no redundancy in this concise line.)\nPacing: 7 (Reasoning: The speech rate of 2.19 is quite slow (68.47 WPM) but appropriate for a poetic delivery. The strategic use of 3 pauses totaling 4.95 seconds creates a rhythmic, contemplative delivery that enhances the line's impact.)\nVocal Variety: 6 (Reasoning: The vocal expressiveness score of 0.372 indicates moderate expressiveness. The pitch range of 65.41 shows some variation but could be more dynamic for poetic delivery. The measured tone appears deliberate for the contemplative nature of the content.)\n\nStrengths\n\nEffective Metaphor Construction: The line creates a powerful comparison between personal transformation and a simple physical action with profound effects. The parallel structure comparing how a person has \"changed me\" with how \"opening a window changes a dark room\" creates immediate visual imagery that enhances understanding of the emotional impact being described.\nEconomy of Language: With only 13 words, every word serves a purpose, creating maximum impact with minimal text. The 100% hapax percentage (every content word appears only once) demonstrates exceptional language efficiency with no wasted words.\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\nVocal Dynamics: The relatively narrow pitch range (65.41) suggests that more vocal variety could enhance the delivery. (Issue: Somewhat flat vocal delivery for poetic content, Evidence: Vocal expressiveness score of 0.372 with limited pitch variation, Suggestion: Incorporate slightly more vocal modulation, especially on emotionally significant words like \"changed\" and \"dark\".)\nVolume Modulation: The low volume mean (0.030) and limited volume range (0.162) indicate a consistently quiet delivery. (Issue: Limited dynamic range in volume, Evidence: Low volume metrics with minimal variation, Suggestion: Incorporate more deliberate volume changes to emphasize key words and enhance the emotional impact of the metaphor.)\n\nContent & Structure Analysis\nThis single line of poetry creates a powerful extended metaphor comparing personal transformation to the physical act of opening a window in a dark room. The metaphor works on multiple levels - suggesting illumination, fresh air, connection to the outside world, and transformation of an enclosed space. The sentence structure builds to the metaphor's completion, starting with the personal impact (\"You've changed me\") and expanding to the comparative image that brings clarity to the nature of this change.\nThe structure follows a perfect comparison pattern that enhances comprehension: the first part establishes the core message (someone has changed the speaker) while the second part clarifies the quality and significance of that change through concrete, visual imagery. This deliberate structure helps listeners not only understand what happened (a change) but precisely how it felt (illuminating, refreshing, transformative). The brevity forces focus on this single emotional truth without distraction."}

I help people overcome their fear of public speaking and deliver amazing presentations. And today I'm going to show you how to captivate your audience within the first five minutes of your presentation. Here's how I'm going to do it. I'm going to show you five steps to deliver a killer opener. If you're watching this, you probably already know that delivering great presentations is critical to advance your career. But did you know that research says that most adults will stop listening to your presentation within the first ten minutes? If they aren't convinced there's something in it for them? The problem is that most people don't know about the skills they need to hook their audience, give a great presentation and overcome their fear of doing it. What am I going to do? Hey Jim, how's it going? I'm freaking out about this big presentation I have to give tomorrow. Did you write out your opener and practice it three times? No. No, why not? I'm terrified and I don't even know where to start. Trust me, I've been in that situation before and it's not fun. So to help you out, I'm going to show you my five-step formula to deliver a killer presentation opener every time. Let's start with step number one, which is give a confident introduction. One of the biggest mistakes people make when they start their presentation is showing nervousness. Here's the key. It's not whether you're nervous. It's whether you show it. The first thing you need to do is stand still. Don't move, don't pace and keep your hands at your sides. This is the most calm and confident stance on the planet and it handles the number one need of your audience, which is to feel safe. Now you can introduce yourself and say, hi, my name is Jason Teetik. When you do this, bring your inflection down at the end to show confidence. Instead of, hi, my name is Jason Teetik. Say, hi, my name is Jason Teetik. See the difference? Now we move on to step two, which is give your credentials. This is where many presenters make the mistake of simply giving their title and years of experience. They say something like, I'm a presentation skills coach and I've been doing it for 20 years. Yet your audience wants to know, what can you do for me? They need to know who you are, why you're the best person to deliver this presentation, what you have to offer them. For example, I might say, I help people overcome their fear of public speaking and deliver amazing presentations. What would that look like for you? To figure this out, you need a short elevator speech. It looks like this. You know how some people have this problem? Well, I offer this solution. The solution you offer is how you help people. For me, it was, you know how some people have a fear of public speaking and have a hard time getting their message across in a presentation? Well, I help them overcome their fear of public speaking and deliver amazing presentations. So, what's your credential statement? You'll be amazed that the effect this has in your audience. Step three is to deliver your hook. My hook for this video presentation might look something like this. I'm going to show you how to captivate your audience within the first five minutes of your presentation. When you do this, you have to get your audience to feel something. How do you get them to feel? You have three choices. You can get them to feel more happy, more successful, or more free. Look at my hook. I said, I'm going to show you how to captivate your audience within the first five minutes of your presentation. When you captivate your audience within the first 5 minutes of your presentation, you'll feel happier because they're listening to you. You'll feel more successful because you look like an expert, and you'll feel more freedom when you spend less time worrying about your presentation than night before. Here's the practical for you. For your presentation, write down the words, I'm going to show you. Then, fill in the rest with something that's going to create more happiness, success, or freedom for your audience. Here's the rule. You can't tell them what they're going to get until you've told them why they would want it. Your hook has to be something that gets them to believe that they want what you're going to give them. Take a moment right now and write down the why for your presentation that will make your audience more happy, successful, or free in their life. And now, we move on to step number 4, which is to introduce your agenda. I recommend you use a PowerPoint for this step, and the slide should look something like this. The purpose of this step is to show your audience the takeaways for your presentation, the things they get to take away and use tomorrow after listening to your presentation. Don't read the slide. They're adults. They can read. Instead, just give them a moment to read it themselves and introduce your agenda by summarizing what you'll be doing. You do this by mentioning the number of takeaways you'll be giving them and paraphrasing the goal of your presentation. Here's what it looks like. I'm going to show you five steps to deliver a killer opener. What would this look like for you? The last step is step 5. Give a credible statement. You can do this by giving relevance or compelling data to your audience to support your message. Remember how I did this at the beginning of this video? I said, you probably already know that delivering great presentations is critical to advance your career. But did you know that research says that most adults will stop listening to your presentation within the first 10 minutes? If they aren't convinced there's something in it for them? And when you do this, within the first two minutes of your presentation, your audience starts to trust you. Without bragging, your listeners start to think, ooh, this guy knows what he's talking about. Done. When I put those five steps together, it sounds like this. Hi, I'm Jason Tiddick. I help people overcome their fear of public speaking and deliver amazing presentations. And today, I'm going to show you how to captivate your audience within the first five minutes of your presentation. Here's how I'm going to do it. I'm going to show you five steps to deliver a killer opener. You probably already know that delivering great presentations is critical to advance your career. But did you know that research says that most adults will stop listening to your presentation within the first 10 minutes if they aren't convinced there's something in it for them? Wow.

He demonstrates his principles in action while teaching them, showing good engagement techniques and clear organization. His rapid speech rate and occasional filler words are areas for refinement, but overall his practical approach successfully models the techniques he teaches.\nKey Scores (1-10)\n\nClarity: 8 (Reasoning: Well-organized five-step framework with accessible language (Flesch-Kincaid: 5.99) and consistent \"tell-show-apply\" pattern enhances understanding despite rapid delivery.)\nEngagement: 8 (Reasoning: Maintains engagement through conversational tone, practical examples, and direct audience connection. Lexical diversity of 0.372 and varied sentence structure keeps audience interest.)\nPacing: 6 (Reasoning: Fast delivery at 183.08 WPM (speech rate: 5.49) with relatively brief pauses (average 0.81s) sometimes rushes through key points, limiting processing time.)\nVocal Variety: 7 (Reasoning: Good vocal expressiveness (0.667) with appropriate pitch variation (range: 269.98) and volume modulation. Effectively demonstrates downward inflection techniques but could be more pronounced in vocal technique examples.)\n\nStrengths\n\nPractical Formula Structure: Provides clear, immediately applicable steps with explanation, demonstration, and implementation instructions for each element, making content highly actionable.\nSelf-Demonstration of Techniques: Effectively models his own advice, using his presentation to demonstrate the five steps he teaches, creating a meta-learning experience culminating in a complete demonstration.\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\nSpeech Rate Management: Speaking too rapidly (5.49 rate) with brief pauses (0.81s average). Suggestion: Incorporate longer strategic pauses (1.5-2s) after key points, especially between steps.\nFiller Word Reduction: 21 total filler words (1.52% rate) including 9 \"like\" instances. Suggestion: Script and rehearse transitions between major points to replace fillers with strategic pauses.\n\nContent & Structure Analysis\nThis presentation teaches a five-step formula for effective presentation openers: confident introduction, credentials, hook, agenda, and credible statement. The structure follows a practical solution-focused approach where each step builds logically on the previous one. The speaker moves from establishing presence to creating connection to providing orientation to establishing expertise. By crafting his own presentation using the formula he teaches, he creates both instructional content and a live demonstration of its effectiveness, concluding with a powerful demonstration of all five steps together."}

It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably it's the only one that can start a war or say, I love you. And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people don't listen to them. Why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world? What I'd like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here, seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list, but these seven I think are pretty large. The habits that we can all fall into. First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit and we know perfectly well the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us. Second, judging. We know people who are like this in conversation and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time. Third, negativity. You can fall into this. My mother in the last years of her life became very, very negative and it's hard to listen. I remember one day I said to her, this October the 1st today and she said, I know, isn't it dreadful? It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative. Another form of negativity, complaining. Well, this is the national art of the UK. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, about sport, about politics, about everything. But actually complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blame thrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions. And again, hard to listen to somebody who's being like that. Penultimate, the sixth of the seven. Embroidery. Exaggeration. It means our language actually sometimes. For example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it? And then of course this exaggeration becomes lying out and out lying and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us. And finally, dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are. Seven, deadly sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is hail and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is I think how our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty, of course. Being true in what you say, being straight and clear. The A is authenticity. Just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people well. For two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously. So hail. Also, now that's what you say and it's like the old song. It is what you say. It's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible. Yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now. Just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with, which will increase the power of your speaking. Register, for example. Now, falsetto, register may not be very useful most of the time. But there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time, but if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians with lower voices. It's true. Because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register. And we have tambour. It's the way your voice feels. Again, the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well, if that's not you, that's not the end of the world. Because you can train, go get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture, with exercises to improve the tambour of your voice. Then prosody, I love prosody. This is the singsong, the meta language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word monotonic comes from or monotonous, monotone. Also, we have repetitive prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends as if it were a question, when it's actually not a question, it's a statement. And if you repeat that one over and over, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame. So let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very, very excited by saying something really, really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize. And at the end of that, of course, is our old friend, Silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit of Silence. In a talk is there. We don't have to fill it with drums and ours. It can be very powerful. Of course, pitch often goes along with pace to indicate a rouse, or you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? Where did you leave my keys? It's a slightly different meaning in those two deliveries. And finally, volume. I can get really excited by using volume. Sorry about that. If I startled anybody, or I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time, try not to do that. That's called podcasting. Imposing your sound on people around you, carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice. Of course, where this all comes into play, most of all, is when you've got something really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech, whatever it is. If it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on. And no engine works well without being warmed up. Warm up your voice. Actually, let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do. Anytime you're going to talk to anybody important, do these. First arms up, deep breath in and sigh out like that. One more time. Very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips and we're going to go bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop. Very good. And now, just like when you were a kid. Now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, beautiful. You're getting really good at this and then rolling our... That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts with we and goes to all the we as high the always low. So you go... We... Fantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause. Thank you. See you. Thank you. Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now. We speak not very well into people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who are listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose or to make that a bit larger? What would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound? That would be a world that does sound beautiful and one where understanding would be the norm and that is an idea worth spreading.

The brevity (just 13 words) creates a powerful impact through its focused metaphorical comparison. The delivery is measured and contemplative, allowing the listener to absorb the emotional weight of the comparison. While the speech rate is slow, this appears deliberate to enhance the poetic delivery, creating an appropriate pace for the content's reflective nature.\nKey Scores (1-10)\n\nClarity: 8 (Reasoning: Despite its brevity, the message is clear through the well-constructed metaphor. The Flesch-Kincaid grade of 5.82 indicates accessibility while maintaining poetic depth. The speech clarity score of 0.485 shows good articulation even with the deliberate slow pace.)\nEngagement: 7 (Reasoning: The metaphorical comparison immediately creates visual imagery that engages the listener. The perfect lexical diversity score of 1.0 means every word is unique and purposeful, with no redundancy in this concise line.)\nPacing: 7 (Reasoning: The speech rate of 2.19 is quite slow (68.47 WPM) but appropriate for a poetic delivery. The strategic use of 3 pauses totaling 4.95 seconds creates a rhythmic, contemplative delivery that enhances the line's impact.)\nVocal Variety: 6 (Reasoning: The vocal expressiveness score of 0.372 indicates moderate expressiveness. The pitch range of 65.41 shows some variation but could be more dynamic for poetic delivery. The measured tone appears deliberate for the contemplative nature of the content.)\n\nStrengths\n\nEffective Metaphor Construction: The line creates a powerful comparison between personal transformation and a simple physical action with profound effects. The parallel structure comparing how a person has \"changed me\" with how \"opening a window changes a dark room\" creates immediate visual imagery that enhances understanding of the emotional impact being described.\nEconomy of Language: With only 13 words, every word serves a purpose, creating maximum impact with minimal text. The 100% hapax percentage (every content word appears only once) demonstrates exceptional language efficiency with no wasted words.\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\nVocal Dynamics: The relatively narrow pitch range (65.41) suggests that more vocal variety could enhance the delivery. (Issue: Somewhat flat vocal delivery for poetic content, Evidence: Vocal expressiveness score of 0.372 with limited pitch variation, Suggestion: Incorporate slightly more vocal modulation, especially on emotionally significant words like \"changed\" and \"dark\".)\nVolume Modulation: The low volume mean (0.030) and limited volume range (0.162) indicate a consistently quiet delivery. (Issue: Limited dynamic range in volume, Evidence: Low volume metrics with minimal variation, Suggestion: Incorporate more deliberate volume changes to emphasize key words and enhance the emotional impact of the metaphor.)\n\nContent & Structure Analysis\nThis single line of poetry creates a powerful extended metaphor comparing personal transformation to the physical act of opening a window in a dark room. The metaphor works on multiple levels - suggesting illumination, fresh air, connection to the outside world, and transformation of an enclosed space. The sentence structure builds to the metaphor's completion, starting with the personal impact (\"You've changed me\") and expanding to the comparative image that brings clarity to the nature of this change.\nThe structure follows a perfect comparison pattern that enhances comprehension: the first part establishes the core message (someone has changed the speaker) while the second part clarifies the quality and significance of that change through concrete, visual imagery. This deliberate structure helps listeners not only understand what happened (a change) but precisely how it felt (illuminating, refreshing, transformative). The brevity forces focus on this single emotional truth without distraction."}

But evolutionarily, 2 million years is nothing. And yet in 2 million years, the human brain has nearly tripled in mass. Coming from the one and a quarter pound brain of our ancestor here, hablis, to the almost three pound meatloaf that everybody here has between their ears. What is it about a big brain that nature was so eager for everyone to have one? Well, it turns out when brains triple in size, they don't just get three times bigger, they gain new structures. And one of the main reasons that our brain got so big is because it got a new part called the frontal lobe, and particularly a part called the prefrontal cortex. Now what does a prefrontal cortex do for you that should justify the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time? Well, it turns out the prefrontal cortex does lots of things, but one of the most important things it does is it is an experience simulator. You know, pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don't make real mistakes in planes. Human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life. This is a trick that none of our ancestors could do that no other animal can do quite like we can. It's a marvelous adaptation. It's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright in language as one of the things that got our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall. Now all of you have done this. I mean, Ben and Jerry's doesn't have liver and onion ice cream, and it's not because they whipped some up, tried it, and went yuck. It's because from without leaving your armchair, you can simulate that flavor and say yuck before you make it. Let's see how your experience simulators are working. Let's just run a quick diagnostic before I proceed with the rest of the talk. There's two different futures that I invite you to contemplate, and you can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer. One of them is winning the lottery. This is about $314 million, and the other is becoming paraplegic. So just give it a moment of thought. You probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought. And interestingly, there are data on these two groups of people, data on how happy they are. This is exactly what you expected, isn't it? But these aren't the data. I made these up. These are the data. You failed the pop quiz in your hardly five minutes into the lecture, because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs, and a year after winning the lotto, lottery winners, and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives. Now don't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz, because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time. The research that my laboratory has been doing, that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing, have revealed something really quite startling to us. Something we call the impact bias, which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly. For the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes are more different than in fact they really are. From field studies to laboratory studies, we see that winning or losing an election, gaining or losing a romantic partner, getting or not getting a promotion, passing or not passing a college test, on and on, have far less impact, less intensity, and much less duration than people expect them to have. In fact, a recent study, this almost floors me, a recent study showing how major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened over three months ago with only a few exceptions, it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness. Why? Because happiness can be synthesized. Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642, I am the happiest man alive. I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches, adversity to prosperity. I am more invulnerable than Achilles' fortune, half not one place to hit me. Kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head? Well, it turns out. It's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all of us have. Human beings have something that we might think of as a psychological immune system, a system of cognitive processes, largely non-conscious cognitive processes that help them change their views of the world so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves. Like Sir Thomas, you have this machine unlike Sir Thomas, you seem not to know it. We synthesize happiness, but we think happiness is a thing to be found. Now, you don't need me to tell you, give you too many examples of people synthesizing happiness, I suspect. Though I am going to show you some experimental evidence, you don't have to look very far for evidence. I, as a challenge to myself, since I say this once in a while in lectures, I took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness. And here are three guys synthesizing happiness. I am so much better off physically, financially, emotionally, and almost every other way. And I'm one minutes regret, it was a glorious experience, I believe it turned out for the best. Who are these characters who are so damn happy? Well, the first one is Jim Wright, some of you are old enough to remember. He was the chairman of the House of Representatives, and he resigned in disgrace when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich found out about a shady book deal he had done. He lost everything. Most powerful Democrat in the country, he lost everything. He lost his money, he lost his power. What does he have to say all these years later about it? I am so much better off physically, financially, mentally, and almost every other way. What other way would there be to be better off? Vegetably, mentally, and mentally. He's pretty much covered in there. Maurice Bicom is somebody you've never heard of. Maurice Bicom uttered these words. Upon being released, he was 78 years old. He'd spent 37 years in Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime he didn't commit. He was ultimately exonerated at the age of 78 through DNA evidence. And what did he have to say about his experience? I don't have one minute or credit. It was a glorious experience. Glorious! This guy is not saying, well, you know, there's some nice guys, they had a gym. It's glorious. A word we usually reserved for something like a religious experience. Harry's Langerman uttered these words, and he's somebody you might have known but didn't. Because in 1949, he read a little article in the paper about a hamburger stand owned by these two brothers named McDonald's. And he thought, that's a really neat idea. So he went to find them. They said, we'd give you a franchise on this for $3,000. Harry went back to New York, asked his brother, who was an investment banker, to loan him the $3,000, and his brothers and mortal words were, you idiot, nobody eats hamburgers. He wouldn't lend the money, and of course, six months later, Ray Crock had exactly the same idea. It turns out people do eat hamburgers. And Ray Crock for a while became the richest man in America. Oh, and then finally, you know, the best of all possible worlds. Some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best, who was the original drummer for The Beatles, until they, you know, kind of like sent him out on an errand and snuck away, and picked up Ringo on a tour. Well, in 1994, when Pete Best was interviewed, yes, he's still a drummer, yes, he's a studio musician. He gave this to say, I'm happier than I would have been with The Beatles. Okay. There's something important to be learned from these people, and it is the secret of happiness. Here it is, finally, to be revealed. First, a crew wealth, power, and prestige, then lose it. But spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can. Third, make somebody else really, really rich, and finally never, ever join The Beatles. Okay. Now, I, like Z Frank, can predict your next thought, which is, yeah, right. Because when people synthesize happiness, as these gentlemen seem to have done, we all smile at them, but we kind of roll our eyes and say, yeah, right, you never really wanted the job. Oh, yeah, right. She, you really didn't have that much in common with her, and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your face. We smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness is not of the same quality as what we might call natural happiness. What are these terms? Natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted, and synthetic happiness is what we make when we don't get what we wanted. And in our society, we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind. Why do we have that belief? Well, it's very simple. What kind of economic engine would keep churning if we believe that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it? With all apologies to my friend, Matt, who recard, a shopping mall full of Zen monks is not going to be particularly profitable because they don't want stuff enough. I want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for. Now, I'm a scientist, so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric, but by marinating you in a little bit of data. Let me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks. And this isn't mine. It's a 50-year-old paradigm called the free choice paradigm. It's very simple. You bring in, say, six objects, and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked. In this case, because the experiment I'm going to tell you about uses them, these are Monet prints. So everybody can rank these Monet prints from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least. Now we give you a choice. We happen to have some extra prints in the closet, and we're going to give you one as you're prized to take home. We happen to have number three and number four. We tell the subject. There's a bit of a difficult choice, because neither one is preferred strongly to the other, but naturally people tend to pick number three, because they liked it a little better than number four. Sometime later, it could be 15 minutes, it could be 15 days. The same stimuli you were put before the subject and the subject is asked to re-rank the stimuli. Tell us how much you like them now. What happens? How much is happiness is synthesized? This is the result that has been replicated over and over again. You're watching happiness be synthesized. Would you like to see it again? Happiness. The one I got is really better than I thought. That other one I didn't get sucks. That's the synthesis of happiness now. What's the right response to that? Yeah, right. Now here's the experiment we did, and I hope this is going to convince you that yeah, right was not the right response. We did this experiment with a group of patients who had enterograde amnesia. These are hospitalized patients. Most of them have Corsakov syndrome, a polyneurotic psychosis that they drank way too much and they can't make new memories. They remember their childhood, but if you walk in and introduce yourself and then leave the room when you come back, they don't know who you are. We took our Monet prints to the hospital. And we asked these patients to rank them from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least. We then gave them the choice between number three and number four. Like everybody else, they said, gee, thanks Doc, that's great. I could use a new print. I'll take number three. We explained we would have number three mailed to them. We gathered up our materials and we went out of the room and counted to a half hour. Back into the room. We say, hi, we're back. The patients bless them. Say, oh, Doc, I'm sorry. I got a memory problem. That's why I'm here. If I've met you before, I don't remember. Really Jim, you don't remember. I was just here with the Monet prints. Sorry, Doc. I just don't have a clue. No problem, Jim. All I want you to do is rank these for me from the one you like the most to the one you like the least. What do they do? Well, let's first check and make sure they're really amnesic. I asked these amnesic patients to tell us which one they own, which one they chose last time, which one is theirs. And what we find is amnesic patients just guess. These are normal controls. If I did this with you, all of you would know which print you chose. But if I do this with amnesic patients, they don't have a clue. They can't pick their print out of a lineup. Here's what normal controls do. They synthesize happiness, right? This is the change in liking score. The change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked. Normal controls show that was the magic I showed you. Now I'm showing it to you in graphical form. The one I own is better than I thought. The one I didn't own. The one I left behind is not as good as I thought. And niezix do exactly the same thing. Think about this result. These people like better the one they own, but they don't know they own it. Yeah, right. That is not the right response. What these people did when they synthesized happiness is they really, truly changed their affective, hedonic, aesthetic reactions to that poster. They're not just saying it because they own it because they don't know they own it. Now when psychologists show you bars, you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people. And yet all of us have this psychological immune system, this capacity to synthesize happiness, but some of us do this trick better than others. And some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situations do. It turns out that freedom, the ability to make up your mind and change your mind, is the friend of natural happiness because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures that find the one that you would most enjoy, but freedom to choose to change and make up your mind is the enemy of synthetic happiness. And I'm going to show you why. Dilbert already knows, of course, you're reading the cartoonism, talking dogbirds, tech support, how come I abuse you? My printer prints a blank page after every document. Why would you complain about getting free paper? Free, are you just giving me my own paper? He gaddman. Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper. Only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same. Now that you mention it, it does seem a little so clear. What are you doing? I'm helping people accept the things they cannot change. Indeed, the psychological immune system works best when we are totally stuck, when we are trapped. This is the difference between dating and marriage, right? I mean, you go out on a date with a guy and he picks his nose. You don't go out on another date. You're married to a guy and he picks his nose. Yeah, he has a heart of gold. Don't touch the fruitcake, right? You find a way to be happy with what's happened. Now what I want to show you is that people don't know this about themselves and not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage. Here's an experiment we did at Harvard. We created a photography course, a black and white photography course, and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a dark room. So we gave them cameras. They went around campus. They took 12 pictures of their favorite professors in their dorm room and their dog and all the other things they wanted to have, Harvard Memories of. They bring us the camera. We make up a contact sheet. They figure out which are the two best pictures. And we now spend six hours teaching them about dark rooms and they blow two of them up and they have two gorgeous eight by ten glosses of meaningful things to them. And we say, which one would you like to give up? I have to give one up. Oh, yes. We need one as evidence of the class project. So you have to give me one. You have to make a choice. You get to keep one and I get to keep one. Now, there are two conditions in this experiment. In one case, the students are told, but you know, if you want to change your mind, I'll always have the other one here. And in the next four days before I actually mail it to headquarters, I'll be glad to, yeah, headquarters. I'll be glad to swap it out with you. In fact, I'll come to your dorm room and give, just give me an email better yet. I'll check with you. You ever want to change your mind? It's totally returnable. The other half of the students are told exactly the opposite. Take your choice and by the way, the mail is going out, gosh, in two minutes to England, your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic. You will never see it again. Now, half of the students in each of these conditions are estimate predictions about how much they're going to come to like the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind. Other students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms and they are measured over the next three to six days on their liking satisfaction with the pictures. Look at what we find. First of all, here's what students think is going to happen. They think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose a little more than the one they left behind, but these are not statistically significant differences. It really, it's a very small increase and it doesn't much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition. Wrong, oh, bad simulators. Because here's what's really happening both right before the swap and five days later. People who are stuck with that picture who have no choice who can never change their mind like it a lot. And people who are deliberating, should I return it? Have I gotten the right one? Maybe this isn't the good one. Maybe I left the good one, have killed themselves. They don't like their picture and in fact even after the opportunity to swap as expired, they still don't like their picture. Why because the irreversible condition is not conducive to the synthesis of happiness? So here's the final piece of this experiment. We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students and we say, you know, we're doing a photography course and we can do it one or two ways. We could do it so that when you take the two pictures, you'd have four days to change your mind or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it, which course would you like to be in? Ha ha. 66% of the students, two thirds, prefer to be in the course where they have the opposite opportunity to change their mind. Hello, 66% of the students choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture because they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows. The Bard said everything best, of course, and he's making my point here, but he's making it hyperbolicly. It is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so. It's nice poetry, but that can't exactly be right. Is there really nothing good or bad? Is it really the case that gallbladder surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing? Ha ha. That seems like a one question IQ test. They can't be exactly the same. In more turgeon prose, but closer to the truth was the father of modern capitalism, Adam Smith, and he said this, this is worth contemplating. A great source of both the misery and disorders of human life seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another. Some of these situations may no doubt deserve to be preferred to others, but none of them can be deserved. None of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardour which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly or by remorse for the horror of our own injustice. In other words, yes, some things are better than others. We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another. But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures, we are at risk. When our ambition is bounded, it leads us to work joyfully. When our ambition is unbounded, it leads us to lie, to cheat, to steal, to hurt others, to sacrifice things of real value. When our fears are bounded, we're prudent, we're cautious, we're thoughtful. When our fears are unbounded and overblown, we're reckless and we're cowardly. The lesson I want to leave you with from these data is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience. Thank you.\n```\n\nFeatures:\n```json\n{\n  \"duration\": 1279.8026757369614,\n  \"pitch_mean\": 204.35549852529022,\n  \"pitch_std\": 60.08057185163763,\n  \"pitch_min\": 65.40639132514966,\n  \"pitch_max\": 864.8821267198209,\n  \"pitch_range\": 799.4757353946712,\n  \"volume_mean\": 0.10074513405561447,\n  \"volume_std\": 0.06090233474969864,\n  \"volume_min\": 8.20797595224576e-06,\n  \"volume_max\": 0.2884853184223175,\n  \"volume_range\": 0.2884771227836609,\n  \"volume_change_rate\": 0.01385231502354145,\n  \"speech_rate\": 4.700724661741895,\n  \"zero_crossing_rate\": 0.11026572769347479,\n  \"num_pauses\": 68,\n  \"total_pause_duration\": 46.64888888888889,\n  \"mean_pause_duration\": 0.6860130718954248,\n  \"pause_frequency\": 0.053133190990433656,\n  \"spectral_centroid_mean\": 1955.2367497861762,\n  \"spectral_bandwidth_mean\": 1810.7326094802913,\n  \"spectral_contrast_mean\": 23.761923336414434,\n  \"mfcc1_mean\": -218.6400146484375,\n  \"mfcc1_std\": 73.00094604492188,\n  \"mfcc2_mean\": 109.91957092285156,\n  \"mfcc2_std\": 55.62027359008789,\n  \"mfcc3_mean\": -19.24087142944336,\n  \"mfcc3_std\": 34.512054443359375,\n  \"mfcc4_mean\": 22.92686653137207,\n  \"mfcc4_std\": 27.159643173217773,\n  \"mfcc5_mean\": -12.07222843170166,\n  \"mfcc5_std\": 23.421995162963867,\n  \"mfcc6_mean\": -13.766494750976562,\n  \"mfcc6_std\": 21.569988250732422,\n  \"mfcc7_mean\": -14.927722930908203,\n  \"mfcc7_std\": 16.027912139892578,\n  \"mfcc8_mean\": -11.061601638793945,\n  \"mfcc8_std\": 13.456009864807129,\n  \"mfcc9_mean\": -16.817672729492188,\n  \"mfcc9_std\": 13.492452621459961,\n  \"mfcc10_mean\": -3.819894552230835,\n  \"mfcc10_std\": 10.720864295959473,\n  \"mfcc11_mean\": -6.3259782791137695,\n  \"mfcc11_std\": 10.897095680236816,\n  \"mfcc12_mean\": -9.709660530090332,\n  \"mfcc12_std\": 9.304254531860352,\n  \"mfcc13_mean\": -10.198224067687988,\n  \"mfcc13_std\": 9.784836769104004,\n  \"word_count\": 3952,\n  \"sentence_count\": 279,\n  \"avg_words_per_sentence\": 14.164874551971327,\n  \"avg_word_length\": 4.2074898785425106,\n  \"unique_word_count\": 951,\n  \"filler_word_counts\": {\n    \"um\": 0,\n    \"uh\": 0,\n    \"ah\": 0,\n    \"er\": 0,\n    \"like\": 21,\n    \"you know\": 7,\n    \"sort of\": 0,\n    \"kind of\": 5,\n    \"i mean\": 2,\n    \"basically\": 0,\n    \"actually\": 2,\n    \"literally\": 0,\n    \"so\": 17,\n    \"right\": 16,\n    \"well\": 8,\n    \"anyway\": 0,\n    \"okay\": 2,\n    \"mmmm\": 0,\n    \"hmm\": 0\n  },\n  \"total_filler_words\": 80,\n  \"filler_word_rate\": 2.0242914979757085,\n  \"lexical_diversity\": 0.4485683987274655,\n  \"most_common_words\": {\n    \"one\": 45,\n    \"'s\": 41,\n    \"n't\": 37,\n    \"happiness\": 28,\n    \"like\": 21,\n    \"'re\": 17,\n    \"really\": 16,\n    \"people\": 16,\n    \"right\": 16,\n    \"know\": 14\n  },\n  \"unique_content_words\": 846,\n  \"hapax_percentage\": 62.88416075650118,\n  \"mean_sentence_length\": 16.118279569892472,\n  \"median_sentence_length\": 13.0,\n  \"min_sentence_length\": 2,\n  \"max_sentence_length\": 63,\n  \"std_sentence_length\": 11.136348953219011,\n  \"sentence_length_distribution\": {\n    \"15-19\": 13.978494623655912,\n    \"5-9\": 28.673835125448026,\n    \"30-34\": 6.093189964157706,\n    \"25-29\": 9.67741935483871,\n    \"20-24\": 8.24372759856631,\n    \"10-14\": 22.22222222222222,\n    \"45-49\": 1.7921146953405016,\n    \"60-64\": 0.7168458781362007,\n    \"0-4\": 5.734767025089606,\n    \"35-39\": 1.7921146953405016,\n    \"40-44\": 0.35842293906810035,\n    \"55-59\": 0.7168458781362007\n  },\n  \"flesch_kincaid_grade\": 6.24887597405424,\n  \"gunning_fog_index\": 9.603196784351283,\n  \"complex_word_percentage\": 9.843117408906883,\n  \"avg_syllables_per_word\": 1.3825910931174088,\n  \"words_per_minute\": 185.27856246546511,\n  \"vocal_expressiveness\": 0.8045116737484932,\n  \"speech_clarity\": 0.4995676142117456\n}\n```", "output": "Overall Assessment\nThis presentation on synthetic happiness effectively balances scientific content with engaging storytelling. At 185.28 WPM, the delivery is energetic yet clear. The speaker skillfully uses real-world examples and experimental evidence to illustrate psychological concepts, with the main improvement area being the 80 filler words (2.02% rate).\nKey Scores (1-10)\n\nClarity: 8/10 (Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 6.25 makes complex concepts accessible; lexical diversity of 0.449 shows balanced vocabulary)\nEngagement: 9/10 (Compelling examples of Jim Wright, Maurice Bicom, and Pete Best; vocal expressiveness score of 0.805 indicates animated delivery)\nPacing: 7/10 (185.28 WPM is somewhat fast for complex content; 68 pauses with average duration of 0.686 seconds may be too brief)\nVocal Variety: 8/10 (Pitch standard deviation of 60.08 and volume standard deviation of 0.061 create engaging vocal patterns)\n\nStrengths\n\nEffective evidence and examples: Combines scientific experiments (Monet prints with amnesic patients) with powerful personal stories (Jim Wright, Maurice Bicom) to illustrate synthetic happiness.\nStrong structure: Progresses logically from mental simulation to challenging happiness intuitions to providing evidence to philosophical conclusion, creating a compelling journey.\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\nReduce filler words: 80 total fillers (2.02% rate), with \"like\" (21), \"so\" (17), and \"right\" (16) being most common. Replace with brief pauses instead.\nModerate speaking pace: 185.28 WPM is too fast for complex educational content. Aim for 150-160 WPM, especially when explaining experiments.\n\nContent & Structure Analysis\nThis presentation explores \"synthetic happiness\" – our ability to manufacture happiness when we don't get what we want. The speaker argues this manufactured happiness is as genuine as \"natural happiness.\"\nThe structure flows from explaining the prefrontal cortex's simulation abilities to demonstrating how these simulations fail (lottery winner vs. paraplegic example), to providing evidence through real-world examples and controlled experiments. Well-placed transitions connect concepts, and the conclusion ties everything together: \"We have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience.\" This approach makes a complex psychological concept both understandable and profound."}
